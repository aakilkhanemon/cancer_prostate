Multiomic Data Analytics Integration in Prostate Cancer

Summary

We plan to perform a multi-omics technologies analysis of data generated from genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomics studies, in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to uncover the mechanism of the tumor progression, identifying distinct tumor subtypes and ultimately finding new prostate cancer biomarkers for effective prognosis, prevention, and therapy and monitoring of drug responses.
