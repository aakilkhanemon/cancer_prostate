##-----------Sample sequence read mapping to reference genome --------REFERENCE GUIDED transcript assembly ----

--- Show retrieval of genome
--- With hisat2 do we need to index the genome? If so, lets show how the indexing is done. 

# If read QC was done, proceed to Mapping of reads to genome to generate a sam file as output using hisat2
# If no reference genome is available, De-novo transcript assembly should be done (e.g. with Trinity, SOAP-Denovo, etc)

### Read mapping to reference genome.
#The output file is a .sam file.

SAMPLE=""
for SAMPLE in $SAMPLES
do
hisat2 -p 8 --dta -x $genome -1 ~/Codeathon/RNA_seq_dataset/${SAMPLE}_1.fastq -2 ~/Codeathon/RNA_seq_dataset/${SAMPLE}_2.fastq -S ${SAMPLE}_output.sam
done

---Convert .sam to .bam file #indicate the the procedure and reason for making such conversion.

#------------  Differential expression analysis ---------------
#Differential expression analysis takes the normalised read count data and performs statistical analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups

---DO the reads mapped (in .sam or .bam) need to be normalised first? If so please indicate the procedure and reason for doing so.

#--------Counting reads--------------

#This process requires a BAM or SAM file as input and files such as GTF or GFF3 specifying the genmoic features
#Count reads per gene
